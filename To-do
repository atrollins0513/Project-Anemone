- Pass the ae::Window class into the current state and allow the state to enable event functions as needed.
  Example: window->enableEvent(Anemone::Window::CHAR_KEY_EVENT);
           window->disableEvent(Anemone::Window::CHAR_KEY_EVENT);
- Improve error checking in the Resource Manager.
- Finish the Sprite class and all related classes.
- Look into writing a texture packing algorithm and creating reference files.
  -> Allow for a sprite to use a texture's name and let the sprite manager take care of sorting based on which atlas
     the desired texture ends up in and what it's relative coordinates are in the atlas.
